<p>Other Fields (2017)
<br><br>
Currently in development with arts editor Alex Zafiris and longtime collaborator Dana Karwas - a book on the role of the artist in the context of our expanding sensory reality. The research is funded by grants from NYU Provost's Graduate Research Initiatives, NYU Humanities Grants-in-Aid, and the NYU Department of Technology, Culture, and Society.
<br><br>
The Satellite (2015)
  <br><br>
Research initiative on the development of a realtime, experiential, and hyper-realistic portrait of Earth, using live data from observation satellites to allow the public a direct encounter with the planet. Working with open data feeds and simulated physics, the research was focused on creating visuals reflective of terrestrial phenomena: land color, cloud volumes, ice cover, lighting strikes, and aurorae. Two years of research were funded by Hewlett-Packard and a demo of the experimental software was featured in TechCrunch.

Wilderness Workshops (2012)
  <br> <br>
Cross-disciplinary education and research on aesthetic experimentation outside the urban setting, including a workshop for artists and engineers in the Hudson Valley and an undergraduate elective at NYU Tandon School of Engineering.
<br> <br>
Prairie Map (2011)
     <br><br>   
A month of field research on the role of technology in land use in the American west led to development of a collaborative map of the North American Priarie ecosystem, including contributions by hundreds of resortation and preservation projects across the continent.
