                        <p>The landscape painter crosses boundaries in search of a composition, treating the land as an aesthetic subject, and thereby released from the constructs of land ownership. The information being created by Earth-observing systems is similarly agnostic to boundaries. A satellite's gaze transgresses legal boundaries while continuously capturing environmental data. The result is an open model of landscape, with resolution that allows us to have a complex, physical encounter with a foreign landscape that parallels traditional picture making <i>sur le motif</i>. 
            </p>
           <p>I use property data to identify large tracts of undeveloped land. As an initial subject, I settled on an expansive property near the Cisnes river in a remote area of southern Chile. Aster GDEM V2 elevation data of the region is used as basis for a polygon model of the terrain, and solar position data allows me to simulate the interaction of light and surface at a specific day and time. A virtual reality headset allows me to explore this terrain model, trekking freely across the landscape at human scale. Despite an uncanny environment, the process is still familiar; I find a composition, frame a virtual camera, adjust lens and exposure, and use it to create a rendered image. The result is a shadow, artifact of presence cast on artifact of place.
            </p>
            
            <p>In a well known painting by Guercino (c. 1620), Shepherds gather at a tomb in a pastoral landscape. A skull on the tomb speaks its inscription, "Even in Arcadia, there am I", an intimation of the universality of death. The scene is premised on a narrative in Virgil's <i>Eclogues</i>. A remote enclave of the Peloponnese, Arcadia is framed as a utopian alternative to the urban culture of Hellenistic Greece. The introduction of this <i>memento mori</i> is meant to undermine the pastoral ideal. In the most analyzed rendering of the scene, by Poussin (1637-38), the shepherd touches the inscription. He seems to trace his own shadow on the tomb, a dark figure that stands in for Guercinoâ€™s skull. He crosses the boundary of Arcadian life to make contact with this reminder of his mortality, yet his gesture also evokes the prehistoric discovery of painting, which presumably was a statement of existence.<sup>1</sup>
            </p>
       
            <p>We seek utopia as a way to escape death in all its subtle manifestations, but mortality violates the premise of the Neolithic paradise myth that drives that utopian ideal in the West.<sup>2</sup> Berger notes that Poussin was a contemporary of Descartes, and sees in his shepherd an attempt to reconcile the alienation between self and nature that is exemplified by the Cartesian division.<sup>3</sup> So I embrace my instinct for incursion, forcing my way into this uneasy dialogue. </p>
